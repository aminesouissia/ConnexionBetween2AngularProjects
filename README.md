# ConnexionBetween2AngularProjects

1: First of all, you have to clone or download the project.

2: have 2 version of Angular Cli (for the Angular 5 project you need version 1.6 and for the Angular 10 project you need version> 10) do not do -g !! they must be installed locally not globally.

3: in the Angular project 5: npm install @ angular / cli @ 1.6

4: in the Angular 10 project: npm install @ angular / cli @ latest or npm install @ angular / cli @ 10

5: After the 2 versions installed do npm install in each project to download the nodes modules

6: on the Angular 5 project do: ng serve --port 1200

7: on the Angular 10 project do: ng serve --port 1100

8: normally you will have the 2 projects open simultaneously.

Here ! You will have a buttom in each project to go to the second project and vice versa.

==> I hope I was clear and I am available for any questions.
